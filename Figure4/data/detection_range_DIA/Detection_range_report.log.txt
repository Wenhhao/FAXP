Thread number set to 56
Output will be filtered at 0.01 FDR
Precursor/protein x samples expression level matrices will be saved along with the main report
Maximum number of variable modifications set to 1
Modification UniMod:35 with mass delta 15.9949 at M will be considered as variable
Mass accuracy will be determined separately for different runs
Scan windows will be inferred separately for different runs
Protein inference will not be performed
A spectral library will be created from the DIA runs and used to reanalyse them; .quant files will only be saved to disk during the first step
Highly heuristic protein grouping will be used, to reduce the number of protein groups obtained; this mode is recommended for benchmarking protein ID numbers; use with caution for anything else
When generating a spectral library, in silico predicted spectra will be retained if deemed more reliable than experimental ones
Fixed-width center of each elution peak will be used for quantification
Interference removal from fragment elution curves disabled
DIA-NN will optimise the mass accuracy separately for each run in the experiment. This is useful primarily for quick initial analyses, when it is not yet known which mass accuracy setting works best for a particular acquisition scheme.

For most diaPASEF datasets it is better to manually fix both the MS1 and MS2 mass accuracies to values in the range 10-15 ppm.
